            <h2>living room</h2>
            <p>In Western architecture, a living room, also called a 
                lounge room, lounge, sitting room, or drawing room,
                 is a room for relaxing and socializing in a residential
                  house or apartment. Such a room is sometimes called a
                   front room when it is near the main entrance at the
                    front of the house</p>

            <p>A bedroom is a room situated within a residential or

                 A typical western bedroom contains as bedroom furniture
                  one or two beds (ranging from a crib for an infant,
                   a single or twin bed for a toddler, child, teenager,
                    or single adult to bigger sizes like a full, double,

             <h2>kitchen</h2>
             <p>A kitchen is a room or part of a room used for cooking and food preparation 
                 in a dwelling or in a commercial establishment. 
                 A modern middle-class residential kitchen is typically
                  equipped with a stove, a sink with hot and cold running
                   water, a refrigerator, and worktops and kitchen 
                   cabinets arranged according to a modular design.
                    Many households have a microwave oven, a dishwasher, 
                    and other electric appliances. The main functions of a
                     kitchen are to store, prepare and cook food (and to
                      complete related tasks such as dishwashing). 
                      The room or area may also be used for dining
                       (or small meals such as breakfast), entertaining
                        and laundry. The design and construction of
                         kitchens is a huge market all over the world.</p>
